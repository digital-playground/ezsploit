# ezsploit
ezsploit is an interactive, automated exploitation tool that simplifies testing known vulnerabilities. Given one or more CVE IDs, it fetches details from CIRCL/NVD, scans the target for relevant services, matches CVEs to open ports, and attempts exploitation using modular Python scripts. Perfect for CTFs, labs, and authorized penetration tests.
